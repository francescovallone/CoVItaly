# CoVItaly 19

CoVItaly 19 is an android app built in flutter.
It's my first android app.
This app fetches the data of Covid emergency from the [public repository of the Protezione Civile Italiana](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19)

## Build this app

You have to create a key.properties file and a key, the tutorial on the [flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#signing-the-app) explains perfectly how to build the app.
